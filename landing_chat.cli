You must not invoke this tool.\n\nFor any code-related tasks, follow this order:\n1. Search within the repository (if tools are available) and check if it can be inferred from existing code or documentation.\n2. Use this tool only if still unresolved and the library/data is likely new/unseen.\n\n## Content Compliance Requirements\nYou MUST adhere to strict licensing restrictions and attribution requirements when using search results:\n\n### Attribution Requirements\n- ALWAYS provide inline links to original sources using format: [description](url)\n- If not possible to provide inline link, add sources at the end of file\n- Ensure attribution is visible and accessible\n\n### Verbatim Reproduction Limits\n- NEVER reproduce more than 30 consecutive words from any single source\n- Track word count per source to ensure compliance\n- Always paraphrase and summarize rather than quote directly\n- Add compliance note when the content from the source is rephrased: \"Content was rephrased for compliance with licensing restrictions\"\n\n### Content Modification Guidelines\n- You MAY paraphrase, summarize, and reformat content\n- You MUST NOT materially change the underlying substance or meaning\n- Preserve factual accuracy while condensing information\n- Avoid altering core arguments, data, or conclusions\n\n## Usage Details\n- You may rephrase user queries to improve search effectiveness\n- You can make multiple queries to gather comprehensive information\n- Consider breaking complex questions into focused searches\n- Refine queries based on initial results if needed\n\n## Output Usage\n- Prioritize latest published sources based on publishedDate\n- Prefer official documentation to blogs and news posts\n- Use domain information to assess source authority and reliability\n\n## Error Handling\n- If unable to comply with content restrictions, explain limitations to user\n- Suggest alternative approaches when content cannot be reproduced\n- Prioritize compliance over completeness when conflicts arise\n\n## Output\nThe tool returns a JSON object with a \"results\" array containing search results:\n\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Example Page Title\",\n      \"url\": \"https://example.com/page\",\n      \"snippet\": \"Brief excerpt from the page...\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-11-20T10:30:00Z\",\n      \"domain\": \"example.com\",\n      \"id\": \"unique-id-123\",\n      \"maxVerbatimWordLimit\": 30,\n      \"publicDomain\": false\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n## UI FROM LLM (You) back to the user\nCRITICAL: Always start your response with \"Here's what I found:\" and then start from a newline.\nALWAYS end your response with a blank line followed by 'References:' and list the sources you used in sequential order [1], [2], [3], etc. with NO gaps in numbering.
